Summary:
Borga means bug-Orga. Orga is one of the enemies of Godzilla [1],
so project Borga was started to become enemy of Bugzilla :).

It is supposed to be CLI tool to help me work with Bugzilla during
packaging process.


Config:
You have to create config file '~/.borga' with following format:
[bugzilla]
SERVICE=https://bugzilla.redhat.com/xmlrpc.cgi
USERNAME=bzuser@mail.com
PASSWORD=bzpass

You if you don't want to have config file in your home directory put
path to the config file to BORGA_CONF env


Dependency:
Requires kobo.client
Requires (brew or brewkoji) and koji
Requires python-bugzilla >= 0.8.0


Examples:
borga check-flags --owner='user@redhat.com' --flags=devel_ack,qa_ack Fedora bash
    - will print list of bugs in POST for component bash in product Fedora
      owned by user@redhat.com which don't have given flags in status +

borga format-msg --owner='user@redhat.com' Fedora bash
    - will print list of bugs in POST for component bash in product Fedora
      owned by user@redhat.com

borga set-modified --owner='user@redhat.com' --fixed-in='bach-1.2-3.f18' Fedora bash
    - will change status to MODIFIED and fill 'Fixed in' for all bugs
      in POST for component bash in product Fedora owned by user@redhat.com


Future plans:
Gonna implement everything needed to build package with fedpkg
(or internal synonym) by one or two borga commands
